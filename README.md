# Welcome to Voyager!


An educational markerless AR based app which presents 4 of NASA's telescopes in an immersive way.
Even though NASA is a very well known organisation yet it is not known to
community which has less knowledge in the field of Astrophysics, therefore
our exciting project that is truly based on marker less AR will excite the
people to know more about the valuable works performed by NASA.
Our solution builds upon the idea of presenting how the discovery in one domain results in findings of other divisions and how various branches of sciences are all interconnected.

Our submission includes an Augmented reality app built using Unity game Engine and AR Core.
The app is based upon markerless AR.

It's UI includes scrolling buttons which when clicked ,the model related to that particular project pops when the screen is tapped.

Taking the example of the first button i.e. the one for the Hubble Telescope , the model augments on the screen when the screen is tapped after  clicking the button .
Further the images ,clips, animation , voiceovers and related texts are augmented along with the rotating model.

Technologies used:
 -  Unity game engine
 - AR Core
